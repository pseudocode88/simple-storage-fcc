# Simple Storage

The first smart contract written based on freecodecamp solidity class.

Functionalities
- Store a favourite number to the contract state variable
- Retrieve the value of favourite number state variable
- Add a person and their favourite number into a state array

Before we used Remix to write and deploy the contract. Now we are using hardhat to setup the local development env to cover up the Remix capabilities.
